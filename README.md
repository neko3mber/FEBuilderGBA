My README
===
I'm just remaking FE8 (The Sacred Stones) into my own version to challenge people. 

The last time when I played FE8 was a long time ago and I missed those days when I had to figure out the strategies to beat the game without guides from the Internet.\
Thus, the nostalgia made me thrive on modding games to challenge myself even further.\
That's being said, I still have a long way to actually do all of these through learning programming languages.\
Later on, I'll try to add features on the FEBuilder (people who built this are amazing, I'm not even gonna lie) and I might organize everything inside the builder.

The original README is from the repository in which I forked from, it also contains the link of FEBuilder downloader.\
I'm just omitting the README, adding my own to clarify what I'll do with the open source codes and making my own version of the game based on the OG.\
Additionally, I'm not doing this commercially so if you like the game and you want to support me (with my mood ofcousre), you can just express "Thank you for the game. It sucks!" (something like that xD).\
I'm doing this out of my own hobby for FE series.\
Any update that I made upon the ROM will be written manually as logs in a .txt file.

My modification
===
- Banning mostly all healing items like vulnerary or elixir (WIP)
- Nerfing healing staves (WIP)
- Currently, I'm only working on Hard mode, Easy and Normal modes may break (most likely) (WIP)
- Making game intentionally harder (enemy, reinforcement, map layout, etc.) (WIP)
- Adding modified weapons (weapon's model is the same as the OG) (Optional)

Downloads
===
Download once:
- Clean ROM: [clean_ROM(FE8).zip](clean_ROM(FE8).zip?raw=1)
- NUPS: [NUPS.zip](NUPS.zip?raw=1)
- VBA: [VBA.zip](VBA.zip?raw=1)

Download again everytime new chapter is edited (Currently editing Ch. 3):
- UPS: [FE-TSS.PATCH.01-07-2025.ups](FE-TSS.PATCH.01-07-2025.ups?raw=1)

How to use
===
Download everything in the "Downloads".\
Then, you extract all of the files inside the NUPS.zip.\
You run the .exe file and choose "Apply an UPS patch to a file". It will open up another menu.\
In the "File to patch", you choose the unmodified ROM (you can get it in clean_ROM(FE8).zip or you can use your one).\
In the "UPS patch", you choose my UPS file.\
Finally, you click "Patch" and there you have it, my remade version inside the ROM :D.\
In order to play, you extract the .exe file inside the VBA.zip.\
Then, you run the .exe file. Inside the emulator, you open the patched .gba file and you start to play.

Controls
===
- WASD / ULDR (key arrows) to move the cursor around.
- LKIO to select / confirm, cancel, automatically place the cursor on blue units, inspect unit at the cursor's position.
- Spacebar to speedup the game.
- Enter to skip cutscenes.
- Shift + F1-10 / Ctrl + S to save current state to the specified slot state / save current state to the oldest slot state.
- F1-10 / Ctrl + L to load a state (if there is) / load the newest slot state (if there is).

P/S 
===
- I'm omitting every other file for now.
- I'm the only one remaking FE8 so it takes time for me to complete anything.
- Please read the progess logs (README.md in FE8_related) before playing any new edited chapter (Edited chapter is now Ch. 2).
